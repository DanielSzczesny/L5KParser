# L5XParser[^1] [![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/DanielSzczesny/L5XParser/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/DanielSzczesny/L5XParser/actions/workflows/maven.yml)
Java L5X Parser for Logix 5000 PLC's

Main reason for creating this project was to find typos in the PLC code

To start application

```java
java -jar JarFileName.jar
```

Application will search a current folder in case of .L5X and .csv files which names match 
e.g. PLC_Code.L5X and PLC_Code.csv. <br />
For each pair report will be generated in folder Reports.



## TODO
- [x] Parse XML to Java Objects
- [x] Prepare basic mapping of typos
- [x] Save result to .txt file
- [ ] Prepare advanced mapping of typos
- [ ] User interface
